Just use leverage. The fee difference between futures and spot is not considered. For example, funding rate, etc.
Only support binance
Only support isolated
Only long, Short is not supported
Not support increasing margin
Not support adjusting leverage when holding positions,This is a limitation of Binance
Please use the 2021.07/2021.08 version of FT. There is no guarantee that the previous or later versions will support.Don't forget pip install -r requirements.txt after updating FT
Prepare
New binance users only support 20x leverage, please confirm whether your account supports higher leverage! Make sure your API is enabled and have Futures permissions Open futures after created the API, the created API still does not support futres, you must create a new API
When the script starts, it will initialize Leverage, PositionsideDual, Isolated, so your position needs to be empty
